# Grid Cell Journal Club

Hello friend!

This repository is a landing page for the Grid Cell Journal Club - once in a while I'll get together with others who are interested in grid cells and chat!

We will try to replicate some exciting papers, or dive into some details, via github gists posted here. After all:
